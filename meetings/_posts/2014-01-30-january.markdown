Happy New Year!

It’s that time of month again. The next meeting will be on Thursday 30th January at the usual Spot, the Electron Club in the CCA. [Open Street Map]. We should be kicking around the Electron Club around 7:30PM on Thursday.

## Home Media

This month, rather than the usual format, where the meeting is focused around a guest speaker – this month we will be trying something a little different. This month we hope to get everyone involved in trying out a few of the Home Media Centre options out there in the open source world. With the recent boost in interest in systems like XBMC, Plex, Plasma Media Centre, etc – we will be taking some time to demo these and see what works, what doesn’t and what could be improved! Any suggestions on apps to try out are more than welcome!

## Open Source and Q&A

As always, we’re going to have a 20 minute session at the end for a Linux or Open Source Q&A session. It is our hope that you can use this time to work on/ with a project that you’re really passionate about, if not get advice on how to go about doing this. We’ll be adjourning to the CCA bar afterwords for more of a chat and a bit of a chill-out

Hope to see you all there!

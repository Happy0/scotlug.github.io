title: Annual Student Society Catchup
---

This month is our annual student welcome event, where we've got members from different local student computing groups coming to tell us about what they do.

So far we have confirmed:

Glasgow University Technology Society

Glasgow Caledonian Ethical Hacking Society

Strathclyde Geek Society

There may be more to come!

Open Source and Q&A as always, we’re going to have a 20 minute session at the end for a Linux or Open Source Q&A session. It is our hope that you can use this time to work on/ with a project that you’re really passionate about, if not get advice on how to go about doing this.

We will be adjourning to a local bar afterwards, the exact location to be confirmed on the night as we need to check on availability of space at the CCA Bar.

title: General Chat and Pub Meetup

This month we will be looking over the website progress and having a discussion led by Calum.

We'll be meeting at the usual time, at the usual place. 7PM - 9PM at the Electron Club.

We will be adjourning to a local bar afterwards, the exact location to be confirmed on the night as we need to check on availability of space at the CCA Bar.

title: General Chat and Pub Meetup
---

This month we have had some troubles organising a main talk.

We're still going to meet up though at the usual time for some general Linux and Open Source chat.

We'll be meeting at the usual time, at the usual place. 7PM - 9PM at the Electron Club.

We will be adjourning to a local bar afterwards, the exact location to be confirmed on the night as we need to check on availability of space at the CCA Bar.

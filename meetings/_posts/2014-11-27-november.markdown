title: General Chat and Pub Meetup
---

This month we will be looking over the website progress and having a discussion led by Calum on the following topic: "What does Linux need to do in order to become a household operating system?". Also, discussion on the meet next month, which will be off schedule and with much more beer.

We'll be meeting at the usual time, at the usual place. 7PM - 9PM at the Electron Club.

We will be adjourning to a local bar afterwards, the exact location to be confirmed on the night as we need to check on availability of space at the CCA Bar.

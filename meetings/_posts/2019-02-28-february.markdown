---

The next ScotLUG meeting will be on Thursday 28th February at the usual spot, the Electron Club in the CCA. We should be kicking around the Electron Club around 6:45 PM. We will be aiming to start the talk at 7:30 PM.

This month, we have Gee talking about his adventures with various home media platforms and how you can use open source tools to hold them all together.

Following the talk we will be adjourning to a local bar, this is likely to be the Terrace Bar of the CCA.

title: Cloud Computing and IoT with the Raspberry Pi
---

The next ScotLUG meeting will be on Thursday 28th April at the usual spot, the Electron Club in the CCA. We should be kicking around the Electron Club around 7:00PM. We will be aiming to start the talk at 7:30PM.

This month we have a talk from Jeremy Singer, a lecturer in Computing Science at the University of Glasgow.

Raspberry Pi devices are everywhere. Almost 10 million units have been shipped. So what are we doing with them? 
In this talk, Jeremy will describe two projects at Glasgow - based on cloud computing (using Raspberry Pi racks to model a micro-datacenter) and internet of things (using Raspberry Pi boards to sense how buildings are being used). This interactive talk will feature Lego, Docker, Space Invaders, Burglar alarms
and other cool stuff.

Jeremy has interests in programming languages, virtual machines, cloud computing and manycore processors. http://www.dcs.gla.ac.uk/~jsinger or @jsinger_compsci for more details.

Hope to see you all there!

title: ScotLUG Social
---

The next ScotLUG meeting will be on tomorrow, Thursday 27th April at the usual Spot, the Electron Club in the CCA.

This month we're not going to have the usual talk but instead, then aim is to meet up at the usual time, then move on straight to the bar for a ScotLUG social.

As always, bring your enthusiasm, we don't get much good weather in Glasgow!

We should be kicking around the Electron Club around 7:00PM.

Hope to see you all there!

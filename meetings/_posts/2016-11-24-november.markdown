title: Investigatory Powers Bill 2016
---

The next ScotLUG meeting will be on Thursday 24th of November at the usual spot, the Electron Club in the CCA. We should be kicking around the Electron Club around 6:45PM. We will be aiming to start this months discussion topic at 7:30PM.

This month we will be shaking the format up a little and we are going to be discussing the recently passed Investigatory Powers Bill: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Investigatory_Powers_Act_2016

Kindly chaired by Euan Birch of the Caledonian University Ethical Hacking Society - we will be starting the evening with some background into the Bill, then we will be breaking out into a set of questions where we can examine the possitive and negative aspects of this new legislation.

To kick things off, the first question will be:
<ul>
  <li>What oversight is there for the various parts of the legislation, and are they sufficient</li>
</ul>

Following the session we will be adjourning to a local bar, this is likely to be the Terrace Bar of the CCA.

title: Post-Referendum Discussion Night!
---

Our next meeting will be on Thursday 25th September at the usual Spot, the Electron Club in the CCA. We should be kicking around the Electron Club around 7:30PM on Thursday.

Thursday 18th of September was an extremely important day for Scotland, regardless which box you crossed!

This month, we have Lynn Kelly, who works in IT within Local Government, and an active member of BCS Glasgow hosting a discussion about what is going to change, or even what isn't going to change in a Post-Referendum Scotland.

Open Source and Q&A as always, we’re going to have a 20 minute session at the end for a Linux or Open Source Q&A session. It is our hope that you can use this time to work on/ with a project that you’re really passionate about, if not get advice on how to go about doing this.

We will be adjourning to a local bar afterwards, the exact location to be confirmed on the night as we need to check on availability of space at the CCA Bar.

As always, for more information – you can visit the website at www.scotlug.org.uk.

Hope to see you all there!

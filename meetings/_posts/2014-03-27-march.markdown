## Scotlug Website

Kenny will be talking about plans for the new website, and taking suggestions for cool new features that we should be building and supporting!

## Open Source and Q&A

As always, we’re going to have a 20 minute session at the end for a Linux or Open Source Q&A session. It is our hope that you can use this time to work on/ with a project that you’re really passionate about, if not get advice on how to go about doing this.

We’ll be adjourning to the CCA bar afterwards for more of a chat and a bit of a chill-out.

Hope to see you all there!

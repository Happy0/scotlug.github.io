The next ScotLUG meeting will be on Thursday 26th January at the usual spot, the Electron Club in the CCA.

We should be kicking around the Electron Club around 7:00PM.

We will be adjourning to a local bar afterwards, the exact location to be confirmed on the night as we need to check on availability of space at the CCA Bar.

This month, Fred Crowson has kindly offered a new talk:

**A brief introduction to networking for sysadmins**

This talk will give brief introduction to those Unix utilities that can help save the day when the pipes in the network get blocked or clogged, or the clean unplugs your router ;~)

Hope to see you all there!

title: ScotLUG December Night Out
---

It's that time of year again!

Every December, we tend to organise a night out. We also tend to break our rule of having our meetings on the last Thursday of the month.

We will all be meeting in the Raven on Renfield St at 7:30PM.

We don't have a set of tables booked to avoid any issues with minimum orders, but we will be easy enough to find.

Hoping to see lots of you there!

title: Vulnerable WordPress in a Corporate Context
---

The next ScotLUG meeting will on Thursday 24th September at the usual spot, the Electron Club in the CCA. 

We should be kicking around the Electron Club around 7:00PM.

We will be adjourning to a local bar afterwards, the exact location to be confirmed on the night as we need to check on availability of space at the CCA Bar.

This month, we have a talk from Euan Birch, of Glasgow Caledonian University Ethical Hacking Society.

Vulnerable WordPress in a Corporate Context. A brief analysis of WPScan as a Cyber Security tool within the new Kali Linux 2.0 environment.

Some information about Euan:

I study Digital Security, Forensics and Ethical Hacking and Glasgow Caledonian University and I'm a 3rd year student. I also run Patch Penguin Cyber Cyber Security and I'm Chief Security Officer there.

Hope to see you all there!

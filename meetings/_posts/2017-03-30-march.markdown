The next ScotLUG meeting will be on Thursday 30th March at the usual Spot, the Electron Club in the CCA.

We should be kicking around the Electron Club around 7:00PM.

We will be adjourning to a local bar afterwards, the exact location to be confirmed on the night as we need to check on availability of space at the CCA Bar.

### Revolutionising the monitoring of Scotland's environment with low-cost remote sensors

The Scottish Environment Protection Agency (SEPA) has a vast monitoring scheme to keep an eye on the status and trends of Scotland's environmental quality. This scheme is traditional, largely manual, expensive and provides only a partial understanding. SEPA is planning to trail new techniques to overhaul and improve the the current monitoring scheme and to open up new opportunities.

Hope to see you all there!

title: Virtual Private ... What?
---

The next ScotLUG meeting will be on Thursday 23rd February at the usual Spot, the Electron Club in the CCA.

We should be kicking around the Electron Club around 7:00PM.

We will be adjourning to a local bar afterwards, the exact location to be confirmed on the night as we need to check on availability of space at the CCA Bar.

This Month we will be hosting a workshop, following a similar theme to last months very successful talk. This month we will be 
covering how to set up and use personal VPNs. Covered in 2 sections:

 * What is a VPN and why might I want to use one?
 * How do I run my own VPN Service?

Hope to see you all there!

title: Keeping Busy - productivity and task management (using open source tools)
---
The next ScotLUG meeting will be on Thursday 25th June at the usual Spot, the Electron Club in the CCA. We should be kicking around the Electron Club around 7:00PM.

We will be adjourning to a local bar afterwards, the exact location to be confirmed on the night as we need to check on availability of space at the CCA Bar.

Greg has this to say:

A few months ago, at FOSDEM, Kenny said to me "you're the most
organised person I know", to which I replied that I'm terribly
unorganised, but that I have a great set of tools to help me cope with
it.

However, it is true that over the last few years, a series of things
have occurred that have forced me to get better at tracking things
that need doing, and managing my time properly. Doing so has lead to
the predictable outcome of being more productive, but also some less
obvious ones which will be discussed at the end of the talk.

This talk will start by covering some of the ideas behind how I handle
my tasks and processes - this is independant of implementation. It
will then cover some possible implementations of those ideas, focusing
mainly on the open-source tools I use personally.

Hope to see you all there!

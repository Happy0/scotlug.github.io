title: Has the desktop computer had it's day?
---

The next ScotLUG meeting will be on Thursday 25th August (Next Thursday) at the usual Spot, the Electron Club in the CCA. We should be kicking around the Electron Club around 7:00PM. We will be aiming to start the talk at 7:30PM.

In line with the past few years, the first meeting after summer has been our planning meeting. We will be getting together to come up with a suggested talk plan and try to flesh out some new ideas for the coming year.

This month we also have Jan, maintainer of EdLUG giving us a brief talk.

In 2014 Jan's PC died leaving her with only an Android smartphone with which to do everything. In this talk Jan will give a brief over view of what she was using her computers for, and a review of the apps she was using on her phone in an attempt to carry on as normal. Whilst this talk is non-technical and based on an admittedly limited experience, it is another data point towards answering the question “Has the desktop computer had it's day?”

We will be adjourning to a local bar afterwards, the exact location to be confirmed on the night as we need to check on availability of space at the CCA Bar.

Once again, lets make the coming year one of ScotLUGs best!

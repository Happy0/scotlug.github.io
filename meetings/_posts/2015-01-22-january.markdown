title: Building redundant & transparent firewalls with OpenBSD
---

The next ScotLUG meeting will be on Thursday 22nd January at the usual Spot, the Electron Club in the CCA. We should be kicking around the Electron Club around 7:00PM.

This month we’ve got a talk by Fred Crowson on about his favourite project: OpenBSD. ScotLUG is happening a little earlier this month as a number of us wont be available the week later.

**OpenBSD: Redundant Transparent Bridges.**
Building Transparent Firewalls with CARP and pf on OpenBSD: a practical
introduction to building redundant firewalls for the practically paranoid.

Open Source and Q&A As always, we’re going to have a 20 minute session at the end for a Linux or Open Source Q&A session. It is our hope that you can use this time to work on/ with a project that you’re really passionate about, if not get advice on how to go about doing this.

We will be adjourning to a local bar afterwards, the exact location to be confirmed as we need to check on availability of space at the CCA Bar.

As always, for more information – you can visit the website at <a href="http://www.scotlug.org.uk">www.scotlug.org.uk</a>.

Hope to see you all there!

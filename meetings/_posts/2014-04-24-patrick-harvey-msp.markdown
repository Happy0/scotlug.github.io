This month, we have a very special talk from Patrick Harvey who will be speaking to us about a set of different subjects:

- Free and open source software in the public sector
- Open document formats
- IT in education
- How the principles of free software movement can be applied in public policy

## Open Source and Q&A

As always, we’re going to have a 20 minute session at the end for a Linux or Open Source Q&A session. It is our hope that you can use this time to work on/ with a project that you’re really passionate about, if not get advice on how to go about doing this.

Where time allows, we may also get a chance to speak about some exciting plans for the rest of 2014, the results from our on-line meeting a few weeks back and and how we're going to push further.

We’ll be adjourning to the CCA bar afterwords for more of a chat and a bit of a chill-out.

As always, for more information – you can visit the website at www.scotlug.org.uk.

Hope to see you all there!

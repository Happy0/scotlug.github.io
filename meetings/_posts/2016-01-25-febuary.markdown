title: Round Table Discussion: How Private is Private?
---

The next ScotLUG meeting will be on Thursday 25th Febuary at the usual Spot, the Electron Club in the CCA. We should be kicking around the Electron Club around 7:00PM.

This month, we will not have our usual talk, but instead - we're going to open to room to a group wide discussion driven by the latest news coming regarding Encryption and Privacy. In particular, we will be discussing the recent case in which Apple are appealing against being forced to create tools which make cracking encryption easier.

We will be adjourning to a local bar afterwards, the exact location to be confirmed as we need to check on availability of space at the CCA Bar.

As always, for more information â€“ you can visit the website at <a href="http://www.scotlug.org.uk">www.scotlug.org.uk</a>.

Hope to see you all there!

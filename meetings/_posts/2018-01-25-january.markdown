The next ScotLUG meeting will be on Thursday 25th January at the usual spot, the Electron Club in the CCA.

We should be kicking around the Electron Club around 7:00PM.

We will be adjourning to a local bar afterwards, the exact location to be confirmed on the night as we need to check on availability of space at the CCA Bar.

This month, we will be hosting a round table discussion and demonstration of the various small form factor devices such as the Raspberry Pi and the Odroid.

Attendees are encouraged to bring their own projects.

Hope to see you all there!

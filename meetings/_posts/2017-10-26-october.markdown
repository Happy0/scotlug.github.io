Hey all!

The next ScotLUG meeting will be on Thursday 26th October at the usual spot, the Electron Club in the CCA. We should be kicking around the Electron Club around 7:00PM.

This month, we are going to be hosting a round-table discussion on automated home assistant devices such as the Amazon Echo, Google Home and Apples Siri. In particular, we'd like to cover:

 * The underlying technology that makes these devices work.
 * The privacy and security concerns that these devices pose.

Given how useful this technology can be, is there a balance that can be found? Is this a technology that we should generally avoid, or is it so useful we should aim to improve and bring into wider use?

We will be adjourning to a local bar afterwards, the exact location to be confirmed on the night as we need to check on availability of space at the CCA Bar.

Hope to see you all there!

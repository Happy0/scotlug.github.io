As makers, tinkerers and general technical people, we find that we are increasingly relying on third party software as a service to organise ourselves. There are a number of Free Software solutions that we can run ourselves as a replacement for some of these products and services.

During this sessions, we are going to discuss:
  
  * Which software-as-a-service products to people use on a day to day basis.
  * Which free software solutions availale, which ones are attendees running for themselves.
  * What are the barriers to self hosting. How much infrastructure do we really need.
  * Are there other community alternatives?
  * Should we care?

Following the talk we will be adjourning to a local bar, this is likely to Henglers Circus, across the road from the CCA. There is no requirement to purchase food or drink if you don't want to.

Hope to see you all there.

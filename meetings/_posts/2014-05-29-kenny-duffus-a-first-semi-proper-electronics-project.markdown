title: A first semi-proper electronics project - Kenny Duffus
---

This month we've got 2 short talks:

Kenny Duffus: A first semi-proper electronics project.

Kenny Coyle:An introduction to Owncloud, taking control of your own data.

More Website Chat For those who are interested, we can hang back after the meeting is finished to kick off the design stage of the new website. Feel free to add some ideas to: https://github.com/ScotLUG/Ideas

Open Source and Q&A As always, we’re going to have a 20 minute session at the end for a Linux or Open Source Q&A session. It is our hope that you can use this time to work on/ with a project that you’re really passionate about, if not get advice on how to go about doing this.

Where time allows, we may also get a chance to speak about some exciting plans for the rest of 2014, the results from our on-line meeting a few weeks back and and how we're going to push further.

We’ll be adjourning to the CCA bar afterwords for more of a chat and a bit of a chill-out.

As always, for more information – you can visit the website at www.scotlug.org.uk.

Hope to see you all there!

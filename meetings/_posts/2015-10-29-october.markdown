title: Vulnerable WordPress in a Corporate Context
---

The next ScotLUG meeting will on Thursday 29th October at the usual Spot, the Electron Club in the CCA.

We should be kicking around the Electron Club around 7:00PM.

We will be adjourning to a local bar afterwards, the exact location to be confirmed on the night as we need to check on availability of space at the CCA Bar.

Unfortunately, the turnout wasn't very high last month, so last months speaker has kindly offered to present his talk again this month. Euan Birch, of Glasgow Caledonian University Ethical Hacking Society.

Vulnerable WordPress in a Corporate Context. A brief analysis of WPScan as a Cyber Security tool within the new Kali Linux 2.0 environment.

Some information about Euan:

I study Digital Security, Forensics and Ethical Hacking and Glasgow Caledonian University and I’m a 3rd year student. I also run Patch Penguin Cyber Cyber Security and I’m Chief Security Officer there.

Hope to see you all there!

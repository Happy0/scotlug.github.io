title: Tech and Linux Chat
---

The next ScotLUG meeting will be this coming Thursday, 30th April at the usual Spot, the Electron Club in the CCA. We should be kicking around the Electron Club around 7:00PM.

Unfortunately, I havent' been able to organise a talk for this months ScotLUG, so I'm looking for Volunteers. I'm looking for 3 - 5 people who can do a quick 10 - 15 minute talk on any Free Software/ Technology Related subject that they are quite passionate about.
If you've event got an idea for a talk, send me a quick email and I'll see if I can organise something!

We will of course have the usual 20 minute slot for Q & A at the end, or we can extend this to the entire meeting.

We're still going to meet up and have the usual Geeky and Linux related chat that we always do, so the meeting hasn't been cancelled. We might however adjourn to the Local Bar a bit earlier than usual.

Hope to see you all there.

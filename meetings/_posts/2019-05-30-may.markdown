Don't you miss the days when the web really was the world's greatest decentralised network? Before everything got locked down into a handful of walled gardens? 

Enter ActivityPub! ActivityPub is a decentralised social networking protocol based on the ActivityStreams 2.0 data format. ActivityPub is an official W3C recommended standard published by the W3C Social Web Working Group. It provides a client to server API for creating, updating and deleting content, as well as a federated server to server API for delivering notifications and subscribing to content.

Mastodon is one of the most feature rich implementations of ActivityPub - join us for a quick demo of what it's capable of and what might come in the near future!

Following the talk we will be adjourning to a local bar, this is likely to be the Terrace Bar of the CCA. There is no requirement to purchase food or drink if you don't want to.

Hope to see you all there.

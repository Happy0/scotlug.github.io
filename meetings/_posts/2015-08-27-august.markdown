The next ScotLUG meeting will be on Thursday 27th August at the usual spot, the Electron Club in the CCA. We should be kicking around the Electron Club around 7:00PM.

We will be adjourning to a local bar afterwards, the exact location to be confirmed on the night as we need to check on availability of space at the CCA Bar.

In line with the past few years, the first meeting after summer has been our planning meeting. We will be getting together to come up with a suggested talk plan and try to flesh out some new ideas for the coming year.

Lets make this year one of ScotLUGs best!

The next ScotLUG meeting will be on Saturday 19th of December at The Counting House, George Square.

We should be kicking around the pub from officially 1930 onwards, though people will be there earlier.

If you don't know where the venue is, consult this link: https://www.openstreetmap.org/node/247937950#map=19/55.86095/-4.25156

Happy Holidays and a New Year.

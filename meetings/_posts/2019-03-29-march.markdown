title: The State of Wireless Security
---

The next ScotLUG will be on Thursday 29th March. This month we have William Nelson talking about the state of Wireless Security.

William will be going over a number of concept:
A brief history of wireless security
The current "best-practices" in terms of configuration and the various options available
A comparison between best practices and the real data gathered from the streets of Glasgow City Centre.

Following the talk we will be adjourning to a local bar, this is likely to be the Terrace Bar of the CCA. There is no requirement to purchase food or drink if you don't want to.

Hope to see you all there.

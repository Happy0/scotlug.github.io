The next ScotLUG meeting will be on Thursday 25th May at the usual Spot, the Electron Club in the CCA.

We should be kicking around the Electron Club around 7:00PM.

We will be adjourning to a local bar afterwards, the exact location to be confirmed on the night as we need to check on availability of space at the CCA Bar.

This months talk has been kindly offered by Graeme Thomson.

Plane Tracking with RTLSDR and Raspberry Pi

Graeme will be bringing an RTL TV Stick, a DIY Antenna and a Raspberry Pi, he will then be demonstrating how a very simple configuration can be used to pick up signals from overhead aeroplanes.

This talk will be primarilly focused on decoding ADSB plane positioning data, feeding to plane tracking websites.

Hope to see you all there!

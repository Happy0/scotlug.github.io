title: June Pub Meet
---

This month, we're having a pub meet, as time has been tight for organisation, and the CCA remains closed due to the Mackintosh fire.

We'll be grabbing our usual spot in the Weatherspoons on Sauchiehall street, in the dining area from around 1830 onwards. Come along to catch up, get a drink, and a meal.

*  the dinning area that we usually sit in is to the right of the entrance, at the end of the bar there are a couple of steps up. Where exactly we sit there depends on where we can get space, though often next to the window. There is also no requirement to order food to be able to sit there if you don't want any.

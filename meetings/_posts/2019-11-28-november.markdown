The next ScotLUG meeting will be on Thursday 28th August at the usual spot, the Electron Club in the CCA. We should be kicking around the Electron Club around 7:00PM.

Following the talk we will be adjourning to a local bar, this is likely to Henglers Circus, across the road from the CCA. There is no requirement to purchase food or drink if you don't want to.

Hope to see you all there.

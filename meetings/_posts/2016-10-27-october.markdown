title: Surviving the "Hug of Death" - Running a Web Server in a modern environment
---

The next ScotLUG meeting will be on Thursday 27th of October at the usual spot, the Electron Club in the CCA. We should be kicking around the Electron Club around 6:45PM. We will be aiming to start the talk at 7:30PM.

This month we have Kenny Coyle presenting a talk/ demonstration.

Over the past few years, it has become much simpler to run and maintain your own Web Server. What happens however, when a piece of content that you are hosting suddenly becomes extremely popular?

In this talk, we will demo a basic web server installation, running on a Raspnerry Pi, hosting a simple piece of content. We will the
n perform a load test that will inevitably break this installation and make the system very unresponsive.

We will then continue to go over setting up the various infrastructure elements that will allow our system to withstand such a heavy
load of traffic and continue to operate (and be responsive).

Following the talk we will be adjourning to a local bar, this is likely to be the Terrace Bar of the CCA.

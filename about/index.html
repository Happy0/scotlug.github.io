    <p><a href="https://webchat.freenode.net/?randomnick=1&amp;channels=%23scotlug&amp;prompt=1">#scotlug</a> is the IRC presence of ScotLUG, the Scottish Linux User Group.  We are hosted on <a href="https://freenode.net/">freenode</a>.  The IRC channel has in many ways come to be the embodiment of ScotLUG due to the immediacy of the media.</p>

    <p>Membership is free and open to anyone anywhere who has an interest in OSS software.  With an average of 40 members on-line at any one time there is usually constant chat, scurrilous rumour and occaisionally high quality help and advice on OSS software and also hardware issues.</p>

    <p>We tend to be mostly Glasgow or West Central Belt based and our (mostly) tight geographical grouping allows for frequent face-to-face meetings and much beer-to-mouth interfacing also.  This all makes ScotLUG a tightly-knit group, perhaps unique amonst IRC channels.</p>
